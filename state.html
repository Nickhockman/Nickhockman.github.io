    <p>Hello I am Nick Hockman, a student from SJSU.  The work in this portfolio was directly from the projects I worked on for Intro Digital Video.  As an artist, I care about improving people's faults when it comes to distractions or addictions.  I work on trying to improve myself and through projects and videos I hope for improving others. In my work I go through problems this generation aregoing through such as short attention span and digital distractions.  Other works I produce falls under comedy.  It's a nice break from all the seriousness of the work and something I genuinely enjoy creating. </p>
