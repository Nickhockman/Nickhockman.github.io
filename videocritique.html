    <p style="background-color:tomato;">My idea for this project is short attention span on smart phones.  What I'm doing is having the entire video take place on someone looking on their phone flipping through some sort of social site.  The phone screen would poetry various videos from memes to news.  The person flipping through will sometimes take a glance into something important or beautiful and then scroll past it after a few seconds.  The ending will be a messsage that says you've caught up then showing the person going all the way back to refresh the page to scroll through more posts.</p>
