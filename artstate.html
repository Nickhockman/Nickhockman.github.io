    <p style="background-color:tomato;">I work with mostly After Effects, but I have begging skills in Maya, Premiere, Lightroom, and Photoshop.  I’ve used After Effects for video editing, coming up with effects, animation and vector art.  With Maya I learned the basics of modeling, rigging and animating in 3D."</p>
