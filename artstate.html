    <p style="background-color:tomato;">I work with mostly After Effects, but I have begging skills in Maya, Premiere, Lightroom, and Photoshop.  I’ve used After Effects for video editing, coming up with effects, animation and vector art.  With Maya I learned the basics of modeling, rigging and animating in 3D."</p>
    <p style="background-color:tomato;">For video editing, I’ve worked on green screening and video cuts mostly in After Effects and Premiere.  In the videos in my portfolio there are examples of video cuts, green screening and adding audio to match the video."</p>
