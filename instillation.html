    <p style="background-color:tomato;">"Eye Thieves" Installation with Digital Video edits onto blank computer screens, game devices and monitors, as well as paper and pencil.

Originally would be projected or have use of the screens, these screens surround this lonely paper and pencil as a simple of your personal or academic work. The screens represents distractions or barriers keeping you from completing or even starting your work. This is the next step from my previous project in keeping you focus by accepting that these are distractions while you are working.
